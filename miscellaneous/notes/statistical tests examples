- mut_matrix_rna ->  0 or 1 per gene per sample (absence or presence of gene mutations).
- rna_mut -> RNA-Seq expression data that matches the mutation  matrix samples.

** T Test **
		Mut (0 or 1) || RNA-Seq
		------------------------
Sample1       0           53
Sample2       0           305
Sample3       1           100
Sample4       1           75



TBD
		Cluster 1 || Cluster 2
		-----------------------
Sample1
Sample2
Sample3
Sample4


Cluster 1

		 Clinical variable || RNA-Seq cluster 1
		----------------------------------------
Sample1         0                  53
Sample2         0                  305
Sample3         1                  100
Sample4         1                  75

Cluster 2

		 Clinical variable || RNA-Seq cluster 1
		----------------------------------------
Sample1         0                  53
Sample2         0                  305
Sample3         1                  100
Sample4         1                  75


** Fisher test **
- Code process:
  1. We are in the column of the Gene 1 (where all the row values are the 0s and 1s of the samples)
  2. We store the count of all the rows that:
   - are 0 and in the cluster 1
   - are 0 and in the cluster 2
   - are 1 and in the cluster 1
   - are 1 and in the cluster 1

   We end up with a matrix that looks like this:
   			Cluster 1 || Cluster 2
   Mut         50          35
   No mut      10          60      

   Where all the numbers are actually frequencies.


So, for clinical data we could have something like:

            Cluster 1 || Cluster 2
   White        50          35
   No white     10          60
